## 🎯 Game Logic

### Sudoku Generation
- Creates complete valid 9x9 Sudoku grids
- Removes cells based on difficulty (easy: 35, medium: 45, hard: 55)
- Ensures puzzles have unique solutions
- Validates all moves against the solution

### Scoring System
- **+10 points** for correct number placement
- **-2 points** for incorrect number placement
- **-5 points** for using a hint
- **Completion bonus** based on percentage completed

### Game Flow
1. **Waiting**: Players join the game room
2. **Playing**: Game in progress, moves being made
3. **Paused**: Game temporarily stopped by host
4. **Finished**: Game completed, winner declared

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run demo**:
   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```

4. **Test functionality**:
   ```bash
   node test-client.js
   ```

## 🌐 Integration

The backend is designed to work with any frontend framework. Key integration points:

- **Socket.IO Client**: Connect to `http://localhost:3001`
- **CORS**: Configured for `localhost:5173` and `localhost:3000`
- **Real-time Updates**: All game events are broadcast to connected players
- **State Management**: Complete game state available on every update

## 🔒 Security & Performance

- **Input Validation**: All moves and game actions validated server-side
- **Rate Limiting**: Could be added for production use
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of inactive games
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user notification

## 📊 Monitoring

- Health endpoint provides server statistics
- Game state tracking for debugging
- Player activity monitoring
- Performance metrics available

The backend is production-ready and provides a complete foundation for a multiplayer Sudoku game!
